/*1. Store few books (hardcoded values with the Book class in previous assignment) in a HashSet and display them using iterator. If any book with duplicate
isbn is added, what will happen? Books are stored in which order? Solve duplicate ISBN problem.*/

/*
  1Q.  If any book with duplicate isbn is added, what will happen?
   		It will get added to HashSet bcoz equals() and hashCode() methods are not written inside class Book.
   		To resolve duplicate values problem , write equals() and hashCode() methods inside class book. 
   		
   2Q.  Books are stored in which order?
   		Random order.
